#Description:
The “Theft Detection System Using Raspberry Pi” is a research project that utilizes Proteus simulation to develop an innovative security system. The project focuses on detecting theft incidents and promptly notifying the user by sending live images of the thief. By combining Raspberry Pi’s capabilities and the Proteus simulation environment, the system can effectively monitor the surroundings and detect any suspicious activities. In the event of a potential theft, the system triggers an alarm and captures live images using a camera module connected to Raspberry Pi. These images are then sent to the user’s device in real-time, providing visual evidence of the thief. The project showcases the potential of using Proteus simulation to create advanced security systems that enhance surveillance and help prevent theft incidents.
#Software Require:
You need to install the Proteus 8.9 version in your laptop. because Proteus 8.9 has in built Raspberry pi library.
